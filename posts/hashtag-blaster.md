Being a longtime WordPress user myself, it was a great thrill to create a plugin that was constructed well enough to be included in the official WordPress Plugin repository.

This plugin amplifies blog content via Twitter with zero effort on the part of the user.

## Technical Details & Takeaways

In building the Twitter Hashtag Blaster, I wanted to provide a free plugin that amplifies blog content. By simply setting your target hashtag, your readers will see a Tweet button at the end of every article that will send your content directly into conversations centering around that topic.

As you can see on the settings page, although the basic form of the Twitter Hashtag Blaster is free, I included an ad upselling the premium version to users that have already installed the free version.
